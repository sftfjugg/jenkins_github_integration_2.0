# Jenkins Github and Docker Containers Integration + Job chaining in Build Pipeline View of Jenkins.
![Jobs](/images/view.jpg)

For the required container images, pull them from https://hub.docker.com/
```
# docker pull a4ankur/jenkins:latest
```
And for the remaining images, you can simply pull official public images from https://hub.docker.com/

## This repo contains following tasks.
1. Create container image thatâ€™s has Jenkins installed  using Dockerfile 

2. When we launch this image, it should automatically starts Jenkins service in the container.

3. Create a job chain of job1, job2, job3 and  job4 using build pipeline plugin in Jenkins 

4. Job1 : Pull  the Github repo automatically when some developers push repo to Github.

5. Job2 : By looking at the code or program file, Jenkins should automatically start the 
	respective language interpreter install image container to deploy code 
	( eg. If code is of  PHP, then Jenkins should start the container that has PHP already installed ).

6. Job3 : Test your app if it  is working or not.

7. Job4 : if app is not working , then send email to developer with error messages.

8. Create One extra job Job5 for monitor : If container where app is running. 
	fails due to any reason then this job should automatically start the container again.
## Solutions for above tasks:-
Dockerfile to build the image.
```

Python script for mailing.
```
#!/usr/bin/python3

import smtplib, ssl
#import getpass  # to take secured stdin for password

port = 587  # Port for starttls
smtp_server = "smtp.gmail.com"
sender_email = "my@gmail.com"
receiver_email = "your@gmail.com"
password = "Type your password and press enter"
message = """
Subject: Notice

This message is sent from Python.
"""
try:
    context = ssl.create_default_context()
    with smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, port) as server:
        server.starttls(context=context)
        server.login(sender_email, password)
        server.sendmail(sender_email, receiver_email, message)
   
#except Exception as err:
#   print('Error Occured : ', err)
except:
    print("Error occurred")
else:
    print("Mail has been sent successfully")
```

After creating above image using
```
# docker build -t <tag-name> <path to Dockerfile>
```
Run the below command to run the container and access docker commands installed on host VM from the guest Jenkins-container.

-p (option for Port Address Translation)
-v (for mounting the volumes)
```
# docker run -d -v /workspace_host/:/workspace_container/ -p 8081:8080 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v $(which docker):/usr/bin/docker jenkins:latest
```
After this, configure your jenkins using the dashboard url of jenkins. http://<hostVM-IP>:8081 This 8081 port is binded to the 8080 exposed port of the container. To get the admin password of the jenkins, run this command,
```
# docker exec <container_ID> <path to the jenkins admin pass>
```
###### Now Create jobs for building job chaining.
## Job1
For github-webhooks's payload url, use ngrok or any other tunneling to create a tunnel which gives you a random public url binded through a publicIP behind the scene.
```
#./ngrok http 8081
```
![ngrok](/images/ngrok.jpg)

Then go to your repo->settings->Webhooks.
![Job1](/images/job1.jpg)

## Job2
Create a dtype_script.py  python script to know the file type in repo.
```
import os
import subprocess as sp
def f1(dir):
    for File in os.listdir(dir):
        if File.endswith(".php"):
            return "php"
        elif File.endswith(".py"):
            return "python3"
print(f1("/workspace_container/"))
```

## Job3
![Job3](/images/job3.jpg)

## Job4
![Job4](/images/job4.jpg)

## Job5
![Job5](/images/job5.jpg)

The hash in the token is generated using, 
```
# sha256 sum <write-any-thing>
```

This repo also has some local hooks, e.g. post-commit, stored at .git/hooks/post-commit
assuming a fast-forward merge.
```
# vi  .git/hooks/post-commit

#!/bin/bash
echo "post-commit tasks are started"
git fetch
git push
echo "post commit tasks are done"

# chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
```
